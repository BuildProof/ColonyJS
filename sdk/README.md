# Colony Starter

_Learn to build with Colony! Get a head start on your next project!_

Colony Starter (formerly known as "Hackathon Starter") includes a variety of starter packages that demonstrate how to use and integrate different tools with Colony.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Yarn 1.7
- Node 9.5

_You may find it helpful to use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to manage node versions._

### Step 1

Globally install the [@colony/colony-starter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@colony/colony-starter) package with yarn:

```
yarn global add @colony/colony-starter
```

### Step 2

Move to your working directory and unpack the [colony-starter-basic](/packages/colony-starter-basic) package:

```
colony-starter colony-starter-basic
```

### Step 3

Move to your new starter directory and checkout the [colony-starter-basic](/packages/colony-starter-basic) readme:

```
cd colony-starter-basic
```

## Starter Packages

Now that you have a basic understanding of how Colony works, check out some of the other starter packages by repeating steps 2 and 3 and substituting `colony-starter-basic` with the package of your choice!
