# Colony Starter

Colony Starter includes a variety of examples to get you up and building with Colony in no time!

## Get Started

This repository is a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). You can use it to create the base of your own Colony project.

### Prerequisites

- Node `>=16.0.0`

_You may find it helpful to use [Node Version Manager (`nvm`)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions._

### Running the examples

First, [use this repo as a template](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyStarter/generate) (**recommended**), then clone it to your machine.

Or clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyStarter.git`

Then install all the required dependencies (this will install [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and [colonyJS](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyJS) as well as some required development dependencies):

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can run the examples:

#### Node.js

```bash
npm run example:node
```

#### Browser (vanilla JS example)

```bash
npm run example:browser
```

#### Some notes

These examples will run on Gnosis chain. If you'd like to make transactions, you will need some XDAI. Reach out to us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/feVZWwysqM) if you're having trouble starting out.
