<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

### `Tokens`

Tokens are always identified and passed by their ERC20 compatible contract address. TODO: elaborate and explain how tokens work in functions

### `Tasks`

TODO: We really need some good explanation on tasks.
Tasks have auto-incrementing integer `taskId`s counting from 1 (TODO: make sure that's correct), so the total count of tasks in a Colony will equal the last `taskId` created.
- Tasks can have different payouts for each role
- Tasks can have different tokens for payout

### `Pots`

TODO: Improve this

Pots can be tied to tasks or to (in the future) domains, so giving them their own mapping.
Pot 1  can be thought of as the pot belonging to the colony itself that hasn't been assigned
to anything yet, but has had some siphoned off in to the reward pot.
Pot 0 is the pot containing funds that can be paid to holders of colony tokens in the future.


### `Rating of work`

TOOD: I think here we should explain how the whole task rating process works.

- submitTaskWorkRating
- revealTaskWorkRating
- assignWorkRating
- generateSecret
- getTaskWorkRatings
- getTaskWorkRatingSecret

### `Roles`

Three roles:
 - Manager (0)
 - Evaluator (1)
 - Worker (2)

A `Role` object looks like this (for a specific task):

```solidity
  address user; // Address of the user for the given role
  bool rated; // Has the user work been rated
  uint8 rating; // Rating the user received
```

TODO: Expand on this more. What scale does the rating have? When can someone be rated and which roles can be rated by whom?
