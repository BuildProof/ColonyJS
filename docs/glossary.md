### `Tokens`

Tokens are always identified and passed by their ERC20 compatible contract address. TODO: elaborate and explain how tokens work in functions

### `Tasks`

TODO: We really need some good explanation on tasks.

Tasks are one of the basic building blocks of a Colony.

Tasks are identified by a unique `{ taskId }`, and contain:

| type | description |
|------------|---------|
|`string`|What work should be done for the task to be considered complete (the task specification)|
|`string` |What work was done to fulfill the task (task deliverable)|
|`boolean`|Whether or not the task has been finalized|
|`boolean`|Whether or not the task has been cancelled|
|`number` |A due date for completion|
|`number` |A payout for the task upon successful completion|
|`number` |A pot from which the payout should be disbursed (read more about (pots)[glossary#pots])|
|`number` |A timestamp for the work that was done|
|`number` |That task's associated domain(s)  |
|`number` |Any skills associated with the task|

### `Pots`

TODO: Improve this

All funding within a colony resides in pots. Pots can be thought of as 'earmarked' funds for a specific purpose, and depending on context, might be called a bounty, a budget, working capital, or rewards.  A colony will have many pots, but at a minimum will have one pot for rewards ( `pots[0]` ) and one for working capital ( `pots[1]` ).

When domains (and tasks within those domains) are created, they each are assigned a newly created pot, which can then be funded with the `moveFundsBetweenPots` function. This action will eventually be mediated by a user's reputation score, but for now is merely permissioned based on the roles defined in `Authority.sol` (meaning only colony owners and admins may move funds between pots).

Every colony has a special pot, `pots[0]`, which accrues funds by taking a small percentage of colony revenue. Members of the colony may claim rewards from this pot based on the number of colony tokens they have.


### `Rating of work`

TOOD: I think here we should explain how the whole task rating process works.

- submitTaskWorkRating
- revealTaskWorkRating
- assignWorkRating
- generateSecret
- getTaskWorkRatings
- getTaskWorkRatingSecret

### `Roles`

Every task has three roles associated with it which determine permissions for editing the task, submitting work, and ratings for performance. In the `colonyNetwork` contracts, the roles are represented as 8 bit numbers to keep permission logic simple.

| role Id | Description |
|------|------|
|`0`| A task's MANAGER role is by default the creator of the task, and usually expected to be the person to accept the task as complete when the work is done.
|`1`| A task's EVALUATOR role is a person who will independently establish the quality of the work done by the WORKER.  
|`2`| A task's WORKER role is the person who will fulfill the requirements of the task as specified in the task brief.


A `Role` object looks like this (for a specific task):

```solidity
  address user; // Address of the user for the given role
  bool rated; // Has the user work been rated
  uint8 rating; // Rating the user received
```

TODO: Expand on this more. What scale does the rating have? When can someone be rated and which roles can be rated by whom?
