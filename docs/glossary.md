### `Pots`

TODO: Improve this

Pots can be tied to tasks or to (in the future) domains, so giving them their own mapping.
Pot 1  can be thought of as the pot belonging to the colony itself that hasn't been assigned
to anything yet, but has had some siphoned off in to the reward pot.
Pot 0 is the pot containing funds that can be paid to holders of colony tokens in the future.

### `Roles`

Three roles:
 - Manager (0)
 - Evaluator (1)
 - Worker (2)

A `Role` object looks like this (for a specific task):

```solidity
  address user; // Address of the user for the given role
  bool rated; // Has the user work been rated
  uint8 rating; // Rating the user received
```

TODO: Expand on this more. What scale does the rating have? When can someone be rated and which roles can be rated by whom?
