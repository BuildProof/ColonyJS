The task lifecycle is a great way to get a complete picture of how colonyJS works with the Colony Network. If you're a seasoned developer, or more of an "I'll just figure it out myself" type, you might want to jump to the [Quickstart](/colonyjs/docs-quickstart/).

The most useful tool within a colony is the `task` method. Tasks are used to coordinate work, track reputation, and ultimately the only way to get paid through a colony. See [tasks](/colonynetwork/docs-tasks/) for a complete description of what tasks are within a colony.

Using colonyJS, you can query the blockchain for information about tasks, create new tasks, modify them, commit and reveal ratings, and finalize them to trigger payouts -- all from within your application.

## Prerequisites
First of all, we will need to set up some prerequisites:

If you don't have them installed already, you'll need to install `nodejs`, `npm`, and `yarn` to your system.

### Colony Network

colonyJS requires the colonyNetwork contracts to interact with. In the working directory of your choice, clone the latest version of the contracts:
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork.git
```

Because colonyNetwork is under continuous development, it's possible that the version you get is ahead of this documentation. Make sure you're on the same page as this guide by checking out a specific version of the contracts:
```
$ cd colonyNetwork/

$ git checkout ce9811a9f0fca53d9ab417d5fc24bbcf29c351c8

$ yarn
```

### Ganache

The colonyNetwork contracts are, for the moment, not on a public network for testing. So to interact with a deployed version of the contracts, you'll need your own local blockchain for testing.

For general development and testing, the full Ganache has a nice UI to get real-time information about your test chain, and instructions for installation can be found on the [website](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/).

We want a bit more flexibility with our accounts (to use in colonyJS), so it'll be easier to use `ganache-cli` in this case.

```
$ yarn global add ganache-cli
```

### TrufflePig
Our application will need its *own copy* of the colonyNetwork contracts to read, so that it knows how to format the data it sends and recieves to/from the blockchain. colonyJS uses the [loaders](/colonyjs/docs-loaders) method to accomplish this.

There are a few different loaders that colonyJS supports to get its contracts from, such as the etherscan.io API. In this case, the contracts we want to use are not deployed yet, so we need to serve them from a local source. Thankfully, we have a trusty TrufflePig!

Install trufflepig globally:
```
$ yarn global add trufflepig
```

TrufflePig will take truffle-generated contract files and serve them to colonyJS over a simple HTTP API for local development.


### Fire up your testing environment

For our local test blockchain, there are a few tweaks to default settings that need to be made: We want to set the `gasLimit` to 7000000, and we want all our account keys to be stored in a .json file that we'll be able to easily call inside our application. With `ganache-cli` we can do this all in one command at start. Open up a new terminal window, and `cd` back to your colonyNetwork/ working directory:
```
$ ganache-cli -d --gasLimit 7000000 --acctKeys ganache-accounts.json
```

This will start up a new test blockchain that keeps account keys in a place that is easy to access for TrufflePig and colonyJS.

Now you need to deploy the Colony contracts to your freshly running local testing blockchain.

Open up a new terminal window, and `cd` to the colonyNetwork directory again.

Deploy your contracts with truffle:
```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/truffle migrate
```
*Note: this step requires that you use a specific version of `truffle` that was included when you set up the colonyNetwork directory with `yarn`. If you have truffle installed globally, using the global version might cause an error*

Wait a little bit for the contracts to complile and deploy on your ganache instance.

After the contracts have deployed, you can start up TrufflePig, pointing it to the same accounts that you created with `ganache-cli`:
```
$ trufflepig --ganacheKeyFile ganache-accounts.json
```


### Initialize your project
Create a new directory for your project, and initialize it with npm
TODO: clarify what steps this hash

Add the required libraries to your project with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @colony/colony-js-client @colony/colony-js-adapter-ethers @colony/colony-js-contract-loader-http ethers
```


###Â Tooling and further reading

It's also beneficial to have a JavaScript environment that supports `async`/`await`, since colonyJS uses Promises extensively. Recent versions of Node and Chrome support Promises out of the box, but you may want to consider using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for better support.

### Example.js

Inside your new project directory, you can then start to work with colonyJS to communicate with your colony. Create a new file `example.js`, and add the following code:

```js
// Import the prerequisites
const { providers, Wallet } = require('ethers');
const { default: EthersAdapter } = require('@colony/colony-js-adapter-ethers');
const { TrufflepigLoader } = require('@colony/colony-js-contract-loader-http');

// Import the ColonyNetworkClient
const { default: ColonyNetworkClient } = require('@colony/colony-js-client');

// Create an instance of the Trufflepig contract loader
const loader = new TrufflepigLoader();

// Create a provider for local TestRPC (Ganache)
const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545/');

// The following methods use Promises
(async () => {
  // Get the private key from the first account from the Truffle config
  const { privateKey } = await loader.getAccount(0);

  // Create a wallet with the private key (so we have a balance we can use)
  const wallet = new Wallet(privateKey, provider);

  // Create an adapter (powered by ethers)
  const adapter = new EthersAdapter({
    loader,
    provider,
    wallet,
  });

  // Connect to ColonyNetwork with the adapter!
  const networkClient = new ColonyNetworkClient({ adapter });
  await networkClient.init();

  // You'll need to either create a new colony or talk to an existing one.

  // To create a new cool colony:
  const colonyData = {
    tokenAddress: '0xf000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Address of the colony's native token
  };

  // Create a cool Colony!
  const { eventData: { colonyId, colonyAddress }} = await networkClient.createColony.send(colonyData);

  // Congrats, you've created a Colony!
  console.log(colonyId, colonyAddress);

  // For a colony that exists already, you just need its ID:
  const colonyClient = await networkClient.getColonyClient(colonyId);

  // Or alternatively, just its address:
  // const colonyClient = await networkClient.getColonyClientByAddress(colonyAddress);

  // You can also get the Meta Colony:
  const metaColonyClient = await networkClient.getMetaColonyClient();

})();
```

Save the file, and run with `$ node example.js` - You should see your new cool colony and token appear on your privat blockchain!


## Task Life-cycle
Once the colony is configured and everything has been initialized, you can start the task workflow.

### Create
A newly created task must be assigned to a domain and must reference a `specificationHash` for the task's completion. Also known as a "Task Brief", the task specification is a description of the work to be done and how that work will be evaluated.

The "root domain" of any colony is `1`, and is the default value for `domainId` if unspecified. 

```js
const { eventData: { taskId } } = await colonyClient.createTask.send({
  specificationHash: 'specification hash goes here',
  domainId: 1,
});
```

Once a task has been created, it can be examined:

```js
const task = await colonyClient.getTask.call({ taskId: 1 });

```

At any time before a task is finalized, the task can be canceled, which allows any funding to be returned to the colony and halts any further modification of the task.

```js
await colonyClient.cancelTask.send({ taskId: 1 });
```

### Modify
After the task has been created, the task may be modified to include additional data. This could be setting the task's worker or manager, or skill tag(s).

```js
// Set the manager
await colonyClient.setTaskRoleUser.send({
  taskId: 1,
  role: 'MANAGER',
  user: 'wallet address of manager',
});

// Set the worker
await colonyClient.setTaskRoleUser.send({
  taskId: 1,
  role: 'WORKER',
  user: 'wallet address of worker',
});

// Set the task Domain
await colonyClient.setTaskDomain.send({
  taskId: 1,
  domainId: 2,
});

// Set the task Skill
await colonyClient.setTaskSkill.send({
  taskId: 1,
  skillId: 5,
});
```
### Modification with Multi-sig Operations
Important changes to a task must be approved by multiple people. Task changes requiring two signatures are:

* Changing the task Brief (Manager and Worker)
* Changing or setting the task Due Date (Manager and Worker)
* Changing or setting the Worker's payout (Manager and Worker)
* Changing or setting the Evaluator's payout (Manager and Evaluator)

Attempting to use these methods without a MultisigOperation will throw an error. You can learn more about Multisignature transactions in colonyJS [here](/colonyjs/docs-multisignature).

### Rate
After the work has been submitted (or the due date has passed), the work rating period begins.

Task payouts are determined by work rating, which is currently implemented as "5-star" system, but which will change to a "3-star" system in the future.

* The Evaluator reviews the work done and submits a rating for the Worker.
* The Worker considers the task assignment and submits a rating for the Manager.

Because work ratings are on-chain, they follow a _*Commit* and *Reveal*_ pattern in which ratings are obscured to prevent them from influencing each other.


* During the *Commit* period, hidden ratings are submitted to the blockchain. The commit period lasts 5 days.

```js
const ratingSecret = await colonyClient.generateSecret.call({ salt, rating });

await colonyClient.submitTaskWorkRating.send({
  taskId: 1
  role: 'WORKER',
  ratingSecret,
});
```

* During the *Reveal* period, users submit a transaction to reveal their rating.

```js
await colonyClient.revealTaskWorkRating.send({
  taskId: 1,
  role: 'WORKER',
  rating,
  salt,
});
```

During the rating period, if either party fails to commit or reveal their rating, their counterpart is given the highest possible rating, and their own rating is penalized.

It's easy to check the status of a task during the rating period:

```js
const { count, timestamp } = await colonyClient.getTaskWorkRatings.call({
  taskId: 1,
});
```

### Finalize

After the rating period has finished, the task may be finalized, which prevents any further task modifications and allows each role to claim their payout.

```js
await colonyClient.finalizeTask.send({
  taskId: 1,
});

await colonyClient.claimPayout.send({
  taskId: 1,
  role: 'WORKER',
  token: 'token contract address',
});
```
