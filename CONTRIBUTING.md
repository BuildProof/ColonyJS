## Report Issues

Report an issue using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyJS/issues). _Please fill out the template with as much detail as possible._

## GitHub Workflow

- Fork the repository

- Clone the forked repository into your working directory

- Create a new branch using the following naming schema:

  - [fix/feature/...]/[issue-#]-[description-in-kebab-case]

  - For example, `feature/6-add-connect-rinkeby-example`

- Commit your changes using the following guidelines:

    - Prefix your commit message with the package you were mainly working on, followed by a colony and space, then the first word is capitalized (e.g. `sdk: Fix Colony roles function`),

- Keep your branch up to date using `rebase` instead of `merge`

- Push your new fix/feature branch to your forked repository

- Create a pull request and fill out the pull request template
